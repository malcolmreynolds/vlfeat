This is my attempt to merge Mikael Rousson's work on python bindings for vlfeat, 
(which as far as I can see hasn't been worked on for 3 years):
https://github.com/mmmikael/vlfeat

with the latest vlfeat development from:

https://github.com/vlfeat/vlfeat

I have done a bunch of hacking it together to get it to compile - in particular,
one linking error I couldn't track down led me to comment out a bunch of 
the functionality in py_vlfeat.cpp because all I'm really interested in for
my own project is the SIFT functionality. I also did a bunch of non portable
stuff to the makefiles to get it to compile.

All I can say is that I have successfully computed SIFT descriptors (which look
reasonable) from images in Python with this version. This should be considered
ALPHA / RESEARCH quality code! It is almost 100% guaranteed to mess up your day
if you rely on it for anything serious!
